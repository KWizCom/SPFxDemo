## File name hash
There has been a report that Microsoft included a flag in later builds of the SPFx that should allow removing the hash from the bundle file name during release builds.
I have yet to confirm that, since updating the SPFx version on an existing project is not a simple task, but regardless it seems this does not provide a way to include the package version in the file name.
